HVM Examples
============

This directory contains just a few examples and cool tricks involving the HVM.
For more comprehensive examples, please visit the
[Wikind](https://github.com/higherorderco/wikind) repository, which has tons of
datatypes and algorithms on the [Kind](https://github.com/higherorderco/kind)
language, which compiles 1-to-1 to the HVM.
